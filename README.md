[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aptible/www.aptible.com.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aptible/www.aptible.com)

## www.aptible.com
This is an Assemble.io-powered static site.

#### Setting up

````
grunt setup
````

#### Local Development

Run `grunt setup` to install Gem, Bower, and NPM dependencies.

Run `grunt server` to see your changes on localhost.

The site is built with [Assemble](http://assemble.io/). Many of the files make use of Assemble's [handlebars-helpers](http://assemble.io/helpers/) library.


#### Deploying
This will release the site to an S3 bucket where it will be immediately accessible at [www.aptible.com](https://www.aptible.com). The `release` commands depend on the [AWS command line tool](http://aws.amazon.com/cli/), which should be set up according to [Aptible's best practices](https://github.com/aptible/aptible-tech-guide/blob/master/doc/SystemsAdministration.md#command-line-access).

````
grunt release:production
````

To release to our staging site ([www.aptible-staging.com](https://www.aptible-staging.com)):

````
grunt release:staging
````

Note: these tasks also run `bundle install`, `npm install`, and `bower install`
to ensure all dependencies are included in deploys.

#### Continuous Deployment

Note that deployment to staging happens automatically on every successful merge to master. This requires the encrypted AWS credentials for an authorized user to be stored in the .travis.yml configuration file.

To update these credentials at any time, run:

    travis encrypt -r aptible/www.aptible.com --add env AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=... AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...

#### Creating a Blog Post

Blog posts consist of combination of [YAML front matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) and [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics).  In order to ensure your post functions properly, you'll need to provide the appropriate YAML front matter at the top of your .md file.

#### Using media in your blog posts

Use the `{{blog_asset_path}}` helper to build a relative URL to the media in the assets folder. The following will generate a path to `assets/aptible.png`. Note that you will still have to use Markdown or HTML syntax to generate the element.

For example:
```
![]( {{ blog_asset_path 'aptible.png' }} )
```
or
```
<img src="{{ blog_asset_path 'aptible.png' }}" />
```

You may also store assets in sub folders

````
![]( {{ blog_asset_path 'logos/aptible.png' }} )
````
